# BFI (Beefy Front Idlers)

![](images/BFI.png)

These idlers were designed with one core principle: use belt tension to *compress* printed layers instead of splitting or pulling them apart.

This design is available for Voron Trident, Voron 2.4, Salad Fork, and Micron.

## BFI for Trident

For Trident, you'll need:
- 4× M5×40 SHCS
- 4× M5 hex nuts
- 2× 5mm-diameter pin, 18mm long

...plus the same shim/bearing stack setup for each idler as the original stock front idlers.

## BFI for Voron 2.4

For V2.4, you'll need:
- 4× M5×30 BHCS 
- 4× M5 hex nuts
- 2× 5mm-diameter pin, 18mm long
- 2× M3 t-nuts
- 2× M3×16 BHCS

...plus the same shim/bearing stack setup for each idler as the original stock front idlers.

## BFI for Ants

For Salad Fork, you'll need:
- 4× M3×25 BHCS
- 4× standard Voron M3x5x4 heatset inserts (5mm outer diameter, 4mm deep)
- 2× M3×12 SHCS

For Micron, you'll need:
- 4× M3×20 BHCS
- 4× standard Voron M3x5x4 heatset inserts (5mm outer diameter, 4mm deep)
- 2× M3×12 SHCS

...plus the same shim/bearing stack setup for each idler as the original stock front idlers.

### But wait, there's more!

The same carriage design has also been applied to work with Micron, Voron 2.4, and Doomcube Z idlers.

# BZI (Beefy Z Idlers)

## BZI for Voron 2.4

For V2.4, you'll need:
- 8× M5 hex nuts
- 8× M5×40 SHCS
- 4× 5mm-diameter pin, 22mm long

You'll reuse the existing M5×30 BHCS and roll-in M5 nuts for mounting to the frame, as well as the 20T toothed idlers from the original stock Z idlers.

## BZI for Micron

For Micron, you'll need: 
- 8× M3 hex nuts
- 8× M3×30 BHCS
- 4× M3×12 SHCS

You'll reuse the existing M3×20 BHCS and preloaded M3 hex nuts for mounting to the frame, as well as the shim/bearing stack setup from the original stock Z idlers.

## BZI for Doomcube

For Doomcube, you'll need:
- 8× M5 hex nuts
- 8× M5×40 SHCS
- 4x 5mm-diameter pin, 22mm long

You'll reuse the existing M5×25 BHCS and roll-in M5 nuts for mounting to the frame, as well as the 20T toothed idlers from the original stock Z idlers.

# Whose fault is all this anyway?

- @clee, initial prototype
- @bythorsthunder, early feedback and testing
- @KayosMaker, first port to V2.4
- @hartk1213, Micron and Doom 

While not directly built upon it, this design is definitely inspired by @Ramalama2's front idlers.
